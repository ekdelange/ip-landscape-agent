# Plasma Control — State of the Art (v0.9)

Exec Summary — frontier, gaps, next tests

1) RF Generators — topology, device tech, efficiency bands, pulsed/multi-freq control  
2) Matching Networks — topology, actuation, algorithms, tuning speed; VI integration; arc response  
3) Vacuum Capacitors — materials, HV/thermal performance, reliability under plasma loads  
4) Control & Sensors — VI probe accuracy/bandwidth; arc detect; control bandwidth & EMC  
5) System Interactions — gen ↔ match ↔ plasma load; trade-offs  
6) Opportunities & Risks — 3–5 hypotheses; constraints
