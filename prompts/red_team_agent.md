# Red-Team Agent — QA & Traceability

- Check every claim in `deck_outline_ip_landscape.md` and `report_sota.md` maps to a traceable dataset row or paper.
- Flag ambiguity/over-claiming. Save findings in `runbooks/red_team_findings.md` and fixes in `runbooks/execution_log.md`.
- Ensure family-level analytics and a ≤36 months "recent filings" lens.
- Verify “opportunities” match real white-spaces and SoTA gaps.
