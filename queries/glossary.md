# Glossary
- VI probe — in-line RF Voltage/Current sensor to infer impedance/power.
- Auto-matching — closed-loop tuning of L/C network to minimize reflected power.
- Pulsed RF — burst modulation (duty, rise/fall) to shape plasma behavior.
- Harmonic control — minimize/exploit harmonics for process outcomes.
- TRL — Technology Readiness Level (1–9) stage-gate framework.
